# Graphics

Just a little program to experiment with computer graphics using OpenGL, GLFW, and Glad.

### Compilation
To compile in Unix-like systems you can use the included makefile:

The program needs GLFW, Glad and cglm.

Clone the submodules if you haven't

`$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/fmaggi/Graphics.git`\
`$ make setup`

This will build the directories and libraries

To compile the executable\
`$ make`

### Extra info

A lot of the code here was inspired by Yan Chernikov's explanations and examples at his youtube channel The Cherno and his game engine Hazel [link](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel).
I am currently trying to write my own physics engine, mainly as a challenge to my self. I am using Box2D by erincatto [link](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) as my reference.
The code is very well written and very understandable.
